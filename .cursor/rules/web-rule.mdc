For web app, here are the guidelines to follow:
- The tech stack is vite+nuxt+typescript+tailwindcss(v4)
- Always use minimalist style if no certain style specified by the user
- Always use inline tailwindcss for style unless a named class is needed
- Always keep style as scoped if possible. Remember to add @reference ".../main.css" to the style scoped
- Prefer to use link instead of button
